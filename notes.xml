    <title>Authority, Duties and Responsibilities of a Commander </title>
    <para>The commander has overall responsibility for the safety of the aircraft, its occupants and its cargo, and
    the authority to issue any commands required to secure this. He has the authority to increase any safety
    margin, including aerodrome operating minima, as he sees fit. In an emergency situation, he has the authority
    to override any rule or procedure in the interest of safety.</para>

      <para>If an aircraft is only being taxied, the occupant of the right seat may be a non-type rated pilot or a

      commander. </para>
      <para>Inexperienced (***) crew must not operate together. A Captain is considered inexperienced

      <title>Cabin crew</title>

      <para>The minimum cabin crew is normally one for every 50 <emphasis> installed</emphasis>
      seats. In extreme circumstances this may be reduced by one cabin crew member providing that:

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Authorisation is received from the duty pilot</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The aircraft does not dispatch from its originating base.</para>

	  <para>A maximum of 50 passengers (not including infants) per cabin crew member is
	  carried.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>All passengers are seated in a position where they can adequately view the safety
	  demonstration.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>If the reduction in cabin crew results in no SCCM being carried there are additional
      procedures detailed in EOM-A 4.1.4g.</para>

      <para>It is permissible to board with one cabin crew member absent provided that:

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The operating SCCM is present.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>A member of the flight crew is on the flight deck. In case of emergency a member of

	</listitem>
 	<listitem>
	  <para>A maximum of 50 passengers per cabin crew member are boarded.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>It is also permissable to board with a non operating crew member provided that they are
      fully qualified on type, in uniform and fit to operate. They are not required to have taken
      part in the pre-flight brief, but must be briefed on their duties during boarding and must
      have answered one SEP and one First Aid question. The non operating crew member must remain
      with the aircraft until the rostered crew member arrives.</para>

      <para>During disembarkation, once there are less than 20 passengers remaining on board the
      required crew complement is reduced to the SCCM and one member of flight crew.</para>

      <para>If a cabin crew member is incapacitated due to sickness, injury, tiredness or fatigue,
      they must be offloaded. They will then be considered unfit to fly until certified fit by a
      doctor or paramedic. This rule may be overridden at the Captain's discretion if "extraordinary
      circumstances" apply.</para>

      <title>Positioning crew</title>


      <para>Positioning crew will normally be booked as passengers and procede through normal
      passenger channels. When arriving on a domestic flight it is permissable for crew to transfer
      aircraft on the ramp, but if arriving on an international flight crew must clear immigration
      and customs before proceding to the aircraft via security search.</para>

      <para>In exceptional circumstances staff may be carried as "extra crew". This requires the
      authorisation of the duty pilot or the Network Duty Manager. In this case, crew must be shown
      on the crew list.</para>

      <title>Flight Ops Inspectors</title>

      <para>Flight Ops Inspectors may, at any time, board any easyJet aircraft and enter and remain
      on the flight deck unless it is the commander's opinion that this would endanger the safety of
      the aircraft.</para>

      <para>Flight Ops Inspectors may act as operating crew with the approval of the duty pilot, but
      may only fly with a training Captain.</para>

      <para>For crew operating under the "easyJet Variation Phase IV" (a.k.a 5/4/5/3), FTL days off
      restrictions will always be satisfied by the fixed pattern, even when a day off has been
      violated by a delay on the last day of a block of late duties. The rostering agreement
      specifies that 10 days off must be achieved in the 28 day reserve period, 3 of these being the
      final three days. In addition the variation specifies that two consecutive days off must be
      achieved within any 10 day period and that two consecutive days off must be achieved after any
      7 consecutive duties.</para>

      <para>Crew who are not operating under a variation require 7 days off in 4 consecutive
      weeks and 24 days off in 12 consecutive weeks. No more that 7 days can be worked between days
      off, and two consecutive days off must be achieved in any 14 day period.</para>

	<title>Increasing maximum flight duty</title>

	<para>The commander may, at his discretion, increase the maximum flight duty detailed in
	<xref linkend="maxfd"/> by up to 2 hours. If required by a delay occuring during the
	turnaround before the final sector of a duty, the maximum flight duty may be extended by a
	further hour. Whenever this discretion is used it must be reported via the journey
	log. Where the discretion is greater than two hours a Discretion Report Form must also be
	completed to allow mandatory reporting to the CAA. There are additional conditions when
	exercising this discretion as part of a sequence of discretion events.</para>

	<para>Reporting times may be delayed by up to 4 hours if the crew member is informed of the
	change before leaving their place of rest. In this case the report time used in <xref
	linkend="maxfd"/> will be the original report time, but the flight duty will be deemed to
	start at the delayed report time. Where a delay is greater than 4 hours, the more
	restrictive of the original and delayed report time will be used when calculating max FDP,
	and the flight duty will be deemed to have commenced 4 hours after the original report
	time.</para>

	<para>Where a flight duty is scheduled such that a rest period of between 3 and 10
	consecutive hours may be taken between sectors, the company can increase the maximum flight
	duty by one half of that rest period. If this method is used, any positioning journeys count
	as sectors. The allowance for inter-sector pre and post flight duties and the type of
	accommodation required are specified in EOM-A 7.1.13.</para>

	<para>easyJet has also negotiated FTL exemptions that allow the maximum flight duty lengths
	in <xref linkend="maxfd"/> to be extended by either 30 minutes or 60 minutes at the planning
	stage. To utilise either of these exemptions a long list of conditions (detailed in EOM-A
	7.1.12.9) must be met. Affected duties are annotated on rosters.</para>

      <para>A "contactable" is a special case of standby. It's duration must be less than an hour,
      it must occur between 06:00L and 22:00L and the minimum time between call out and report must

      <para>A "morning start duty" (MSD) is a duty with a report time between 03:00L and 09:29L. An

      report time between 18:00L and 03:00L that finishes between 03:00L and 17:59L. A transition
      occurs when an EFD occurs immediately after an MSD or vice versa. It is possible for a single
      duty to be both an MSD and an EFD, and this also constitutes a transition.</para>

      <para>When crew are operating under the "easyJet Variation Phase IV" (a.k.a 5/4/5/3), only one
      transition is allowed per duty block. In addition, the August 2009 Rostering resolution prohibits

      <title>Minimum flight altitudes</title>
      <sect3><title>Definitions</title>

      <para>When operating on a defined route segment, national authorities may have published the
      Minimum Enroute IFR Altitude (<emphasis role="strong">MEA</emphasis>) for that segment. This
      altitude (or flight level) ensures obstacle clearance and navaid reception. On Jeppesen
      enroute charts it is shown below the approximate center of the route segment in small red
      font. Where a segment is wholly contained within controlled airspace, the MEA will provide a
      buffer of at least 500ft from uncontrolled airspace {TODO: This information comes from an FAA
      handbook and comparison of Jepp enroute charts and UK AIP airway specification. Confirm that
      it is correct}. Where applicable, national authorities may also publish a lower segment safety
      altitude which provides obstacle clearance only. This is called the Minimum Obstruction
      Clearance Altitude (<emphasis role="strong">MOCA</emphasis>). On Jeppesen charts, MOCA is
      presented adjacent to, and in the same font as, MEA; a suffix of "T" (e.g. 4200T) is used to
      distinguish it. Where MOCA is not presented, it may be assumed that it has the same value as
      MEA.</para>

      <para>When national authorities have not defined MEA, Jeppesen presents a value known as
      the Minimum Off-Route Altitude (<emphasis role="strong">MORA</emphasis>). This is in the same
      font as the MEAs, and is distinguished by an "a" suffix (e.g. 4200a). Jeppesen derives this
      value by examining charts or databases of known obstacles and terrain. The value should ensure
      at least 1000ft clearance of all obstacles within 10nm of any point on the route segment. When
      the obstacles are over 5000ft altitude, 2000ft of clearance is provided. MORA is also
      presented on the LIDO OFPs.</para>

      <para>When not operating on a defined route segment, Jeppesen presents area obstacle clearance
      data in the form of a Grid Minimum Off-Route Altitude (<emphasis role="strong">Grid
      MORA</emphasis>). This is again a Jeppesen derived value. It should provide the same obstacle
      clearance as MORA within the area enclosed by the latitude and longitude lines of a Jeppesen
      enroute chart. It is presented in large green or red font near the centre of the applicable
      area<footnote><para>Red is used when the value is greater than
      14,000ft</para></footnote>.</para>

      <para>Minimum Safe Altitude (<emphasis role="strong">MSA</emphasis>) is the minimum altitude
      that provides 1000ft of obstacle clearance within 25nm (unless otherwise specified) of a
      specified navigation facility. It is published as a circle on Jeppesen plates. Where the
      circle is divided into segments, the altitudes are referred to as Minimum Sector Altitudes. It
      is for emergency use only, and does not necessarily guarantee navaid reception.</para>

      <para>Minimum Vectoring Altitude (<emphasis role="strong">MVA</emphasis>) is the lowest
      altitude at which an IFR aircraft will be vectored by a radar controller (excepting SRAs
      etc.); it may only be utilized upon the controller's determination that an adequate radar
      return is being received.</para>

      <sect3><title>Corrections</title>

      <para>All published altitudes must be corrected for low temperatures. Altitudes within 5000ft
      of the elevation of the source of a QNH measurement can be corrected for temperatures below 0°C
      using the table presented in EOM-A 8.1.1.3.1.<footnote><para>This table is also available on
      page 8.02 of the QRH.</para></footnote> A graph is presented below this table to correct
      higher altitudes for temperatures below ISA.</para>

      <para>When operating within 20nm of terrain that has an elevation greater than 2000ft, a
      correction must be applied for wind. This is done using the table presented in EOM-A
      8.1.1.3.2, although a correction of 2500ft will always be conservative.</para>

      <para>When operating in low atmospheric pressure conditions with an altimeter setting of 1013,
      the aircraft will be ~30ft below the indicated altitude for every millibar that the QNH is
      below 1013. This can be applied as a positive increment to a published minimum altitude to
      calculate a minimum flight level.</para>

      <para>Note that the MORAs presented on the LIDO OFPs do not have any of these corrections
      applied.</para>

      <sect3><title>Operational requirements</title>

      <para>When operating under IFR<footnote><para>Authorisation from the post holder flight
      operations is required to fly VFR.</para></footnote>, the minimum enroute altitudes should be
      the higher of the corrected MOCA and the corrected MORA. EOM-A 8.1.1.2.3.1 states:

      <blockquote><para>"During flight preparation, the en-route minimum altitudes must be
      established for all the route segments".</para></blockquote>

      The OFPs provide uncorrected MORAs only. Therefore, as part of pre-flight preparation, MOCAs
      for each route segment should be extracted from the Jeppesen en-route charts and compared to
      the OFP MORAs, and the higher of these values should then be corrected for temperature and
      wind to establish en-route minimum altitudes {TODO: this is clearly impractical - check
      whether my interpretation is incorrect}.</para>

      <para>Engine failure or loss of pressurisation may lead to a requirement for en-route
      descent. Currently, the highest obstacle affecting easyJet routes is Mont Blanc at
      15,771ft. This is at least 2000ft below the A319 green dot one engine ceiling assuming MTOW
      and ISA+20. Thus, there are currently no special drift down diversion procedures in place. In
      the case of emergency descent following loss of pressurisation, all obstacles must be cleared
      by at least 2000ft. It is worth noting that the time of useful consciousness without
      supplementary oxygen is 30 minutes at 18,000ft.</para>

      <para>Obstacle clearance for take-off and initial climb phase is provided by a combination of
      LPC performance calculation and SID and Engine Out SID design. Note that easyJet SOPs for loss
      of thrust after divergence point are contrary to the specific Airbus recommendations in FCOM
      4.4.30.4000; this can lead to some unwelcome grey areas in obstacle clearance.</para>

      <para>For the approach phase, unless in visual contact with the ground with flight visibility sufficient
      to identify all relevant obstacles, flight below MSA should only be conducted on promulgated
      routes or instrument approach procedure or when being vectored at levels not less than
      MVA.</para>

	<title>Reducing fuel loads to allow increased payload</title>

	<para>Where payloads are such that the carriage of normal fuel loads results in exceedence
	of structural or performance limitations, EOM-A 8.1.7.4 presents a number of methods of
	reducing fuel requirements below those that would normally apply.</para>

	<para>The simplest method is to reduce the trip fuel requirement once it is certain that the
	SID and/or STAR that will be flown requires less track mileage than those anticipated in the
	OFP route. The adjustment is 4kg per nm.</para>

	<para>More significant reductions can be acheived when the conditions for not requiring a
	destination alternate (see <xref linkend="alternates"/>) are met. In this case, the
	alternate fuel can be replaced with 15 minutes of holding at destination.</para>

	<para>Finally, for sectors of over 1000nm, contingency fuel can be reduced from 5% to 3%
	providing that a suitable en-route alternate is specified. The procedure is detailed at
	EOM-A 8.1.7.4.4. Note that a new OFP should be used; OCC were unable to provide one last
	time I asked.</para>

      <sect3><title>Structural weight limitations</title>

      <para>The aircraft operating manual specifies maximum ramp, take-off, landing and zero fuel
      weights. The maximum take-off weight may also be reduced by easyJet to take advantage of
      reduced ATC charges; where this has been done, the new MTOW must be treated as a structural
      limit. These limitations are also presented in the weights block of the OFP.</para>

      <para>The basis for calculations to determine compliance with these structural limits is the
      Dry Operating Weight (DOW). The DOW is the total weight of the aircraft with no usable fuel or
      payload. It is available at the top of the OFP, but the canonical value is that contained in
      the LPC database unless otherwise notified by a flight brief notice. Other weights are
      calculated as follows:

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) = DOW + payload</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Ramp weight (RW) = ZFW + total fuel</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Take-off weight (TOW) = RW - taxi fuel</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Landing weight (LW) = TOW - trip fuel</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>In addition to the main structural weights, there are maximum load limits for the cargo
      compartments. These may be found in FCOM 2.1.20.5000.</para>

	<para>The prologue pages include the Certificate of Release to Service, records of
	Acceptable Deferred Defects (ADD), the Damage Register and "Briefing Notes to Crew". These
	must all be checked prior to accepting an aircraft.</para>

	<para>Each page in the main section is divided into a defect section and four tear-off
	sector record strips. Unused strips on the current page should be struck out if any entry
	has been made in the defect section or when a crew change occurs without a direct
	handover.</para>

	<para>The top half of each sector record strip is for recording details of a sector after it
	has been completed. The Log Time and Landings brought forward boxes are no longer used and
	should be struck through. The "Full Rated Thrust T/O" and autoland reporting are only
	relevant to the 737 fleet. If the record of the previous sector is found to be incorrect or
	incomplete on arrival at an aircraft the duty pilot must be contacted for authorisation to
	continue.</para>

	<para>The bottom half of the strip is used to record pre-departure data and acceptance of
	the aircraft. The "Oil Check" and APU oil level boxes are not relevant to flight crew and
	should be struck through. The ambient temperature fuel uplift should be recorded rather than
	temperature corrected figures. To calculate approximate uplift in kg, multiply the uplift in
	litres by 0.8. If anti-icing is carried out more than once it will be necessary to use
	multiple strips; each strip must have a copy of all the pre-departure data.</para>

	<para>Each main section page has three coloured carbon copy sheets. The pink page is used to

	  the defect does not affect airworthiness (consult MOC if there is any doubt), then it does

	<para>MOC must be contacted whenever a defect is entered in the tech log. Where possible MOC
	will arrange for engineering to rectify the defect or clear it to an ADD sheet in accordance
	with the MEL.</para>

	<para>When no engineering support is available, MOC may request that flight crew either
	carry out certain limited engineering tasks in accordance with EOM-A 8.1.11.5 or clear a
	defect to the ADD pages. Deferral of defects by flight crew is only possible when the defect
	is assessed by MOC as having no effect on airworthiness or when the relevant MEL entry has
	no maintenance actions specified.</para>

	<para>To defer a defect the commander should make an entry in the "ACTION TAKEN" column with
	the MEL reference, repair interval and ADD number. The commander signs for this in the
	"ACTION TAKEN" column; MOC will arrange for the Release to Service column to be signed off
	by a licenced engineer at the earliest opportunity. The relevant ADD entry should then be
	completed. If the defect does not affect airworthiness, it should be entered on the level 2
	(blue) ADD sheet. Otherwise, it should be entered on the level 1 (pink) sheet. The complete
	tech log defect description should be transferred, along with the tech log page reference
	and item number, any MEL/CDL reference number and limiting criteria (e.g. expiry date). The
	ADD sheet should not be signed by the commander; it will be signed off by the engineer who
	signs the release to service.</para>

	<para>Successful computer resets on the Airbus should be recorded by making a suitable entry
	in the defect section, e.g. "CREW RESET: COM CIDS 1+ 2 FAULT ON THE GROUND, SUCCESSFUL RESET
	AS PER QRH". Information that may be useful but which does not require immediate engineering
	action may, with MOC's agreement, be recorded as a "FOR INFO" entry in a similar way,
	e.g. "FOR INFO: FMGC1 FAILED. RECOVERED WITH NO CREW INTERVENTION". These entries do not
	count as open defects, so signatures should be placed below the entry and the associated
	"Action Taken" and RTS sections should be struck through.</para>

      suspended immediately. In the unlikely event that it becomes necessary to uplift wide cut fuel
      there are extra safety restrictions detailed in EOM-A 8.2.1.</para>

      <para>The fuel card may be used to expedite the fuelling process, but fuel requirement must

      any passengers remain on board it must be delayed until all relevent restrictions have been
      met. Communication between flight deck and refueller is required prior to commencement of
      refuelling. Positive acknowledgement of the fuel card by the refueller is deemed sufficient to
      fulfill this requirement, but the member of flight crew on the flight deck must remain in
      "visual contact" with the refueller whenever any passengers are on board. {TODO: EOM-A is
      incredibly wooly on this; confirm meaning}. The fuel card must be stowed once fuelling is

        <title>Types of fluid</title>

        <para>ISO Type I fluid has a high glycol content and low viscosity. De-icing performance is good, but protection
        from freezing precipitaion is poor. It is best used for removing frozen deposits as part of a two stage process
        or when precipitation has stopped. Type I fluids are usually clear or light orange.</para>

        <para>ISO Type II fluid includes a pseudo plastic thickening agent. This allows it to remain on the surface
        after application to provide protection from freezing precipitation. Shearing of the fluid allows it to flow off
        the critical surfaces as airspeed increases. Type II fluids are usually straw coloured.</para>

        <para>ISO Type IV fluid is similar in operation to Type II fluid, but uses more advanced thickening systems to
        give longer holdover times. Type IV fluids are usually green.</para>

        <para>Heated water may be used as the first step of a two step process. All fluids may be
        diluted with water. Required Type I fluid concentration is a function of OAT only, as
        dilution has a negligible effect on holdover. Required Type II and Type IV concentrations
        are a factor of OAT and holdover requirements.</para>

        <para>A walk-round inspection should be completed by a qualified person after de-icing is completed. Flying and
        control surfaces should be clear of deposits, intake and drain holes should be clear of obstructions and a check

      RVSM airspace in a -300, the altimeters should be within 40ft of each other [33V Vol-1
      Limitations]. If any doubt exists concerning altimeter accuracy, an expanded procedure using QFE checks
      is available in [Ezy-A 8.3.3].</para>
      <para>Main altimeters should be set to QNH before take-off and then set to 1013 when first cleared to a flight
      level. The standby altimeter should be set to QNH for take-off, and then set to 1013 when passing MSA. In the
      descent, the main altimeters should be set to QNH when first cleared to an altitude and the standby altimeter
      should be set to QNH when passing FL200 or at TOD if cruising below FL200.</para>

      <para>Flights of less than 20 minutes do not require a fuel check. Flights of less than one hour require a single
      fuel check, and flights of more than one hour require fuel checks at not more than hourly intervals. A fuel check
      should compare actual and planned consumption, check the remaining fuel is sufficient and determine expected fuel
      on arrival. The fuel total used should be the lower of the FMC totalized figure and the total from the fuel
      gauges.</para>
      <para>If it is determined that fuel on landing at destination will be below CMR, action must be taken to reduce
      fuel burn. Options include flying at LRC or CI=0, changing levels or requesting shortcuts. If fuel burn cannot be
      reduced sufficiently to land with more than CMR, a decision must be made whether to divert or continue to
      destination. A decision to continue to destination is a committal to land there, and is permissable if landing is
      assured and the maximum anticipated delay is known. A landing is considered assured if no forecast weather
      deterioration or single failure of ground or airborne equipment can prevent landing. In general this means that
      Cat I minimas must be available at Cat III equipped aerodromes and non-precision minimas must be available at Cat
      I equipped aerodromes.</para>
